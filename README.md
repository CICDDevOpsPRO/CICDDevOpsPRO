👋 Hi, I’m @CICDDevOpsPRO. I'm passionate about all things DevOps and CI/CD.
👀 I’m interested in automating software development pipelines, containerization, and cloud-native technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced DevOps practices and exploring new tools like Kubernetes and Helm.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source DevOps projects and innovative CI/CD solutions.
